				<h1>How to Write a Case Study Analysis [+ Free Case Study Template]</h1>

						Here are the guidelines to teach you how to write a case study Pick your case study subject with the best-completed work supported by measurable results that show how you solved a client problem.  Gather as much information as possible across the entire story... Write your case study with a narrative that is memorable. Design the case study so it's visually appealing enough for prospects to read.  There is a difference between learning how to write a case study and learning how to write a case study that is memorable. That persuades. That sings from the rooftops, “Just look at these results — you know you want to work with us!” Unfortunately, many of the case studies I’ve read are boring, self-aggrandizing, and uninspiring. That’s because most organizations know they need case studies, but fall terribly short in execution.

						At IMPACT, website redesign projects make up a big chunk of our business. From day one, designing and building websites has always been one of our core offerings. However, as design and technology trends have come and gone, our design and development teams have grown in scale and expertise by leaps and bounds, and our options for content management systems have grown as well. Over the years, we’ve settled on two platforms on which we build websites: HubSpot and Wordpress. Of the 50+ websites we build in a year, at least 75% of them are on HubSpot. Why? I’m so glad you asked! Here are the five main reasons we recommend HubSpot as our CMS of choice to our clients:

						We all know the story of Jack and the Beanstalk. In this classic fairy tale, poor little Jack’s mother gets majorly miffed when her son comes home with a hand full of “magic beans” instead of the money she hoped for after sending him out to sell their only cow. In her eyes, Jack was taken advantage of and manipulated into an unfair exchange and chances are, she wouldn’t be alone in these feelings. (I mean, let’s face it, those beans must’ve had one heck of salesman.) Like in the story, salesmen and marketers often get a misleading rap of being manipulative or tricking people into buying things they usually wouldn’t (or shouldn’t.)
